Mr. Jack is now playing some dice games. In this game, 2 dice are rolled.
The score is calculated by summing the value on the 2 dice. However, when playing in special mode, if the number on both dice are
equal, then one value is incremented, wrapping around to 1 if its value was 6.
Write a program to calculate the score. The inputs are 2 integers and 1 boolean. Each integer has the value of one of the dice. The
boolean is true if the special mode is being played, otherwise it is false. You have to print the score depending on the values.
Use the System.out.println() statement for printing.
Example Input: 4 3 false
Output: 7
Example Input: 4 4 false

You and your friend are movie fans and want to predict if the movie is going to be a hit!
The movie’s success formula depends on 2 parameters:
·         the acting power of the actor (range 0 to 10)
· the critic’s rating of the movie (range 0 to 10)
The movie is a hit if the acting power is excellent (more than 8) or the rating is excellent (more than 8). This holds true except if either
the acting power is poor (less than 2) or rating is poor (less than 2), then the movie is a flop. Otherwise the movie is average.
Write a program that takes 2 integers:
·         the first integer is the acting power
· second integer is the critic’s rating.
You have to print Yes if the movie is a hit, Maybe if the movie is average and No if the movie is flop.
Example input: 9 5
Output: Yes
Example input: 1 9
Output: No
Example input: 6 4

Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions – anomalous or exceptional
conditions requiring special processing – often changing the normal flow of program execution. (Wikipedia)
Java has built-in mechanism to handle exceptions. Using the try statement we can test a block of code for errors. The catch block
contains the code that says what to do if exception occurs.
This problem will test your knowledge on try-catch block.
You will be given two integers and as input, you have to compute . If and are not bit signed integers or if is zero,
exception will occur and you have to report it. Read sample Input/Output to know what to report in case of exceptions.

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Example 1:
Input:
3
3 0 1
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not
appear in nums.
Example 2:
Input:
2
0 1
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not
appear in nums.
Example 3:
Input:
9
9 6 4 2 3 5 7 0 1
